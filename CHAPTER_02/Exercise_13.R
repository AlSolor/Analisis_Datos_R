#After obtain the results we can see that the scores of both genders are pretty close.
#Womens present a higher mean, but it is very close to the mean of men
#With the boxplot we can see that men have a larger dispersion, but with a higher value on the thir cuartile
#We will conclude that both groups present the same scores
